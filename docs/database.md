The `videos` table in the SQLite database, as defined in the `db_functions.py` file, is structured to store various pieces of information related to YouTube videos. Here's a breakdown of its columns:

1. **id**: This is the primary key of the table. It is an integer type and serves as a unique identifier for each record in the table.

2. **video_title**: A text field that stores the title of the video. It cannot contain null values.

3. **video_url**: Another text field that holds the URL of the video. Like `video_title`, this field also cannot accept null values.

4. **author_url**: A text field storing the URL associated with the author or uploader of the video. This field is not nullable.

5. **author_name**: A text field containing the name of the author or uploader of the video. This field must have a value; it cannot be null.

6. **caption**: A text field intended to store any captions associated with the video. This field can be left empty.

7. **transcript**: A text field designed to hold the transcript of the video. Similar to the `caption` field, this can be left empty.

8. **summary**: A text field meant to provide a brief summary of the video content. Unlike other fields marked as not nullable (`NOT NULL`), this field does not enforce a non-null constraint, meaning it can be left empty.

9. **model**: A text field presumably used to indicate which model or algorithm was used to process or analyze the video data. This field must have a value; it cannot be null.

10. **timestamp**: A text field that records the date and time when the video information was inserted into the database. This field is required and cannot be null.

This table is designed to support operations such as inserting new video entries, querying existing ones based on various criteria (e.g., author, video title, or timestamp), and potentially updating or deleting records. The use of a primary key (`id`) facilitates efficient retrieval and manipulation of specific video records.
